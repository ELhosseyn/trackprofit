# Orders API Error Workaround

If you're seeing the error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findUnique')", there are a few things you can do to fix it:

## Immediate Solutions

1. **Use the Direct Load Button**: I've added a "Direct Load (No Cache)" button at the top of the page. This button will load the orders directly without using the cache.

2. **Add ?refresh=true to the URL**: You can also add `?refresh=true` to the end of the URL to bypass the cache.

3. **Use Mock Data**: For testing the UI, you can add `?mock=true` to the URL to load mock data.

## Permanent Solutions

1. **Set up the AppCache table**: 
   Run this command in your terminal:
   ```
   cd /Users/elhosseyn/Desktop/app/trackprofit && node scripts/setup-app-cache.js
   ```

2. **Apply a schema migration**:
   If you're seeing database errors, you may need to apply a Prisma migration:
   ```
   cd /Users/elhosseyn/Desktop/app/trackprofit && npx prisma migrate dev --name add-app-cache
   ```

3. **Disable cache permanently**:
   You can modify the app.orders.jsx file to bypass the cache entirely by editing the loader function.

## Technical Background

The error occurs because the application is trying to use a database table called "AppCache" that doesn't exist in your database. This table is used to cache order data to improve performance.

I've already added a workaround that will allow the application to function even if the cache is not available, but for best performance, you should set up the AppCache table as described above.
